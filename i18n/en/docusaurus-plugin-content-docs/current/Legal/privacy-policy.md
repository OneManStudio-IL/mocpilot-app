# Privacy Policy

Maksim Nemna created the MOCPilot application as a commercial application. 
This SERVICE is provided by Maksim Nemna and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors about my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if someone decides to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used to provide and improve the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are available on MOCPilot, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience while using our Service, I may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information. The information I request will be stored on your device and will not be collected by me in any way.

## Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in case of an application error, I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called "Log Data." This Log Data may include information such as your device’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, application configuration when using my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. They are sent to your browser from the websites you visit and stored in your device’s internal memory.

This Service does not explicitly use these "cookies." However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use cookies to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some parts of this Service.

## Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:

- To facilitate our Service;
- To provide the Service on our behalf;
- To perform Service-related services; or
- To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

## Security

I value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information, so we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

These Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can take the necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

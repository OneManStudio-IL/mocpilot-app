### Changes

- **Fixed a bug in the blocks palette collection selector**: selecting a collection, scrolling to another, and returning had no effect.
- **Fixed a crash when loading heavy profiles** with a large number of blocks.
- **Added “Axes type” property** to joystick settings to support **single-axis mode** (X, Y, XY).
- **Added colorization** for steering wheel controllers (“GMZ”, “No Mercy”).
- **Added “is pressed” blocks** for steering wheels and pedals.

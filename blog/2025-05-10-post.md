### Changes

- **Added tablet layout** for better utilization of larger screens.
- **Fixed a bug where the "hub button pressed" block** appeared for hubs that do not support this action. Also fixed inappropriate **color sensor blocks** for unsupported hubs (e.g., BuWizz).
- **Fixed a bug where the "motor run" block** didn’t affect motors without encoders due to missing alternate run commands.
- **Added a page for testing gamepad buttons.**
- **Added a hub testing page** with a dashboard showing information, connected port devices, and port shake status.
- **Fixed incorrect accelerometer data interpretation** for BuWizz 2 and 3, which caused faulty orientation readings.
- **Fixed RAM memory leaks** that led to app termination on some devices due to high system memory usage.
- **Fixed bugs in profile loading** that previously caused crashes in certain scenarios.
- **Fixed an Android bug** where releasing gamepad sticks did not reset axis values to zero.

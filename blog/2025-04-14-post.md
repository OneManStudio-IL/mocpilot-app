### Changes

- **Fixed a bug causing high CPU usage, battery drain, and low performance.**
- **Fixed a bug where gamepad blocks** (e.g., “is button pressed”, “is D-PAD button pressed”) **couldn’t be attached to other blocks.**
- **Fixed an issue in the step switch event block** that incorrectly handled touch events and step counting.
- **Fixed a bug in the list block’s “item of”** where no more than one block could be attached as an argument index.
